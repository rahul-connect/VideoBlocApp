# Basic FLutter Bloc Video App

A basic application to demonstrate the bloc pattern in flutter using firebase as backend. 
Since my focus was on bloc that is why the app is very simple and doesnt have much functionalities.

Steps:
#Create a new firebase project and paste the google-services.json file in the android/app folder.<br>
#Create a new user by entering username and password in firebase (Since only login functionaity is there)
